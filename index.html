                    <h2><a href="">The Things They Carried by Tim O’Brien
                    </a></h2>
                    <span>By Reader's Digest Updated: Dec. 01, 2022</span>
                    <p>
                        O’Brien’s modern classic centers on the 
                        Vietnam War, but these are not your 
                        traditional war stories. The author, who 
                        based this book on his own service in 
                        Vietnam, along with its aftermath, not 
                        only chronicles the war in these related s
                        hort stories but also pulls back the 
                        curtain on the very act of storytelling 
                        and the impossibility of ever capturing 
                        the full truth. As the narrator says,
                         “Often the crazy stuff is true and the 
                         normal stuff isn’t.” 
                         This deeply moving, profoundly
                          thought-provoking book continues to 
                          speak to all generations of readers.

                    <h2><a href="">The Secret Lives of Church Ladies by Deesha Philyaw</a></h2>
                    <span></span>
                    <p>
                        Published in 2020, Philyaw’s dazzling 
                        debut is racking up staggering accolades 
                        for good reason. She invites us into the 
                        lives of Black Southern women in a way 
                        that is intimate, tender, and deeply 
                        engaging. Here is how she opens: “Eula 
                        books the suite in Clarksville, 
                        two towns over. I bring the food. 
                        This year it’s sushi for me and cold 
                        cuts and potato salad for her.” And with 
                        that, you’re in the door. Here are more 
                        books by Black authors you’ll want to know 
                        about.
